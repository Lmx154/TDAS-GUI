## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (v7 or later)
- **Rust** (v1.60 or later)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)
- **Git**

### Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/das-gui.git
   cd das-gui
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Backend**

   Navigate to the backend directory and build the Rust components.

   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo build
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Application ▶️

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

> **Note**: When making changes to the frontend, simply rerun the above command. For backend changes, you may need to clean and rebuild Cargo as described in the Development Workflow section.

## Usage 📈

### Serial Port Communication 🔌

Connect to your telemetry device via serial port:

1. **List Available Ports**

   Use the application interface to view available serial ports.

2. **Open a Connection**

   Select the desired port and baud rate, then establish a connection.

3. **Close the Connection**

   Easily disconnect when you're done.

### Data Recording and Parsing 📊

1. **Start Recording**

   Begin capturing serial data to a text file with a single click.

2. **Automatic Parsing**

   DAS-GUI parses incoming data in real-time, computing averaged telemetry metrics for clarity.

3. **Manage Files**

   Create and list text files within the data directory to organize your recordings.

### Real-time Data Visualization 📉

Monitor your telemetry data live with dynamic charts and tables:

- **Acceleration & Gyroscope**: Visualize motion data across all three axes.
- **Environmental Metrics**: Track temperature, pressure, altitude, and humidity.
- **GPS Data**: View location coordinates, speed, altitude, and satellite information.
- **Signal Strength**: Monitor RSSI and SNR for connection quality insights.

## Telemetry Data 📡

### Data Format 📝

Data is received in the following structured format:

```
[timestamp] accel_x, accel_y, accel_z, gyro_x, gyro_y, gyro_z, imu_temp, bme_temp, bme_pressure, bme_altitude, bme_humidity, gps_fix, gps_fix_quality, gps_lat, gps_lon, gps_speed, gps_altitude, gps_satellites
```

### Data Buffering System 🗃️

To ensure smooth and accurate real-time visualization, DAS-GUI implements a robust data buffering system.

#### Configuration ⚙️

- **Default Buffer Size**: 10 samples
- **Default Output Rate**: 10Hz
- **Input Data Rate**: ~100Hz

#### How It Works 🛠️

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw telemetry data arrives at approximately 100Hz.
2. **Circular Buffer Storage**: Data is stored in a `VecDeque` to maintain a fixed buffer size.
3. **Averaging Mechanism**: Once the buffer is full and the emit interval is reached, data is averaged.
4. **Emission**: Averaged data is emitted at the specified rate (default 10Hz) for smooth visualization.

#### Adjusting the Buffer 🔧

To modify buffer settings, locate the following line in `src-tauri/src/data_operations.rs`:

```rust
let buffer = Arc::new(Mutex::new(TelemetryBuffer::new(10, 10.0)));
```

- **First Parameter**: Buffer size (number of samples)
- **Second Parameter**: Emit rate in Hz

## Development Workflow 🔄

### Initial Setup 🛠️

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

### Making Frontend Changes ✏️

- Modify React components or Tailwind CSS styles.
- Run the development server without cleaning Cargo:

  ```bash
  npm run tauri dev
  ```

### Making Backend Changes 🔧

1. **Clean Cargo Build**

   Navigate to the backend directory and clean the Cargo build:

   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo clean
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Rebuild and Run**

   Restart the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

## Building for Production 🏗️

1. **Clean Cargo**

   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo clean
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Build the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

   The built application will be available in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
