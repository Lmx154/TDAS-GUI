## Features

- **Serial Port Communication**: Open and close serial port connections (Rust). See [`serial_operations.rs`](src-tauri/src/serial_operations.rs).
- **File Operations**: Create and list text files in the data directory (Rust). See [`file_operations.rs`](src-tauri/src/file_operations.rs).
- **Telemetry Data Display**: Real-time display of telemetry data including acceleration, gyroscope, temperature, pressure, altitude, humidity, GPS data, and signal strength (Rust). See [`data_operations.rs`](src-tauri/src/data_operations.rs).
- **Data Recording**: Record serial data to a text file. Data recording happens at full speed without buffering, thanks to Rust's performance and concurrency capabilities. See [`data_operations.rs`](src-tauri/src/data_operations.rs).
- **Data Parsing**: Parse incoming serial data and compute averaged telemetry data. Rust's speed and efficiency ensure quick and accurate data parsing. See [`data_operations.rs`](src-tauri/src/data_operations.rs).
- **Real-time Updates**: Listen for telemetry updates and display them in the UI (ReactJS).
- **High-Frequency Data Handling**: Record data and get real-time telemetry data at 100Hz with no issues, leveraging Rust's performance.

The application implements a data buffering system to smooth out high-frequency telemetry data for smoother real-time data visualization:

### Configuration
- Default buffer size: 10 samples
- Default output rate: 10Hz
- Input data rate: ~100Hz

### How it works
1. Raw telemetry data comes in at ~100Hz
2. Data is stored in a circular buffer (VecDeque)
3. When buffer is full:
   - Oldest sample is removed
   - New sample is added
   - Average is computed if enough time has passed
4. Averaged data is emitted at specified rate (default 10Hz)

### Adjusting the Buffer
To modify the buffer settings, locate this line in `src-tauri/src/data_operations.rs`:

```rust
let buffer = Arc::new(Mutex::new(TelemetryBuffer::new(10, 10.0)));
```

## Workflow

1. First run: `npm install`
2. Second run: `npm run tauri dev`

When making changes to the frontend, you can get away with not cleaning cargo and just running: `npm run tauri dev`

If you make any changes to the backend, no matter how small, clean cargo by navigating to `src-tauri` (assuming you're in project root): `cd src-tauri`
then run: `cargo clean`
after that you can go back to root: `cd ..`
now you can test your changes using: `npm run tauri dev`

## Build 

Always clean cargo before build. To do this first you must change directory to `src-tauri` (assuming you're in project root): `cd src-tauri`
next, run: `cargo clean`
then you should go back to root: `cd ..`
after cargo has been cleaned you can now build: `npm run tauri build`

## Testing 

Run tests before making a PR or committing your changes.
